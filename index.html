				<h2>Welcome D &amp; IT Nollan!</h2>
				<p>
					We have only very little planned when it comes to actual activities.
					But please read this text all the way through and see what we have in mind for this evening.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal is to have a study-friendly environment in here.
					We believe this is accomplished by having very few interruptions.
					So if we have have minor things to communicate, we'll update this page. <strong>Ctrl/Cmd + D is your friend</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please grab yourselves a cup of coffee/tea and a fruit/something sweet.
					We want no leftovers, but please make sure everybody gets their share before you go for seconds. <br>
					Feel free to have a look around at the office, but <strong>please leave the Office area to the employees.</strong> <br>
					After that Grab a seat, and look around for signs with the internet details.
					Please feel free to use the meeting rooms that are labeled after famous Gothenburg Artists. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					We assume you already have assignments from school to do.
					If you need help with these. Ask <strong>the older students for help</strong>, this is why we brought them here for you guys! <br>
				</p>

				<p>
					But if you're already finished and thirst for more we have some suggestions. <br>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Help your friends! <br></li>
						<li><a href="https://labs.spotify.com/puzzles/">Solve puzzles!</a> <br></li>
						<li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Challenge yourself!</a> <br></li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				</p>
					There is a gaming room, feel free to relax there and challenge your friends to FIFA if you find it.
					Flipper and pingis tables are FFA as well.
				<p>
				<p>
					You're all wecome to stay until 21:30. But after that we need to start cleaning up.
